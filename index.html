                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Gender equality, also known as sexual equality or equality of the sexes, is the state of <br> equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, including <br> economic participation and decision-making; 
                    and the state of valuing different behaviors, <br> aspirations and needs equally, regardless of gender. (Wikipedia)</p>

                <h2> Gender Equality Over Various Regions </h2>
                <p> Different parts of the world are home to various cultures and ethnicities and thus also <br> house different perspectives on equality among the
                    genders. The following map <br> visualization (right) shows the <b>global ranking</b> of each country's equality throughout the years. <br> This is to provide insight on which
                    countries have the most equal opportunities <b>amongst <br> other countries in the region</b> and to view how each country improves or neglects gender <br> equality
                    within their borders.

                <h2>Country Rankings Over The Years</h2>
                <p>For those seeking countries with equal opportunities, 
                    it is important to take note of how a <br> specific country ranks over time, as this is a 
                    clear indicator as to whether or not gender <br> equality is the forefront of the country's concerns.
                    The bump chart shows how the rankings <br> of the <b>10 most gender equal countries in 2006</b>  change
                    from the <b>years 2006 to 2013.</b> To <br> further assist with comparisons between countries, the option to filter
                    countries is present, <br>   this can be done by shift-clicking multiple countries from the legend. <br>
                    <br>
                    The top 10 most gender equal countries in 2006 include <b>Denmark, Finland, Germany, <br> Iceland, Ireland,
                        New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Sweden, United Kingdom.</b>

                <h2>Country Scores Over The Years</h2>
                <p> <i>Similar</i> to the reasoning of the bump chart provided above, the comparisons of scores <br> would also provide
                    the same information but with deeper insight, it has the <b>added benefit <br> of not falling or rising in relation to the
                        scores of other countries.</b>  A comparison utilizing <br> scores instead of ranks would be more objective despite the similarity.
                    The provided Line Chart <br> shows how the overall score's of the <b>top 30 countries regarding gender equality</b> change <br> over the years,

                    Similar to the line chart, the heatmap shows how scores for the <b>top 30 countries change over the years,</b> 
                    the main advantage of the heatmap over the line graph is to compare the scores between all countries at once.
                    For example the visualization shows that the countries with the highest equality with least variability over the years include
                    <b>Sweden, Iceland, Norway and Finland.</b>

                <h2>Correlation Of Equality In Various Aspects In A Country</h2>
                <p>
                    Gender equality is often measured on a more precise and refined scale. In essence, gender equality within a 
                    country can be subdivided into various categories, some of these subcategories include <b> Economic participation
                    and opportunities, Educational Attainment, Political Empowerment, and Healthcare equality. </b> The scatter plot
                    highlights how these 4 attributes correlate to one another, since all correlation lines point up and leftward,
                    <b> all 4 have a positive correlation with one another.</b> Due to the concentration of the points, the distribution 
                    may not be clear, as such a zoom feature is provided which can be used by scrolling the mouse wheel while hovering
                    over a scatter plot, along with this translation is also provided to further explore the distribution which can be
                    accessed by clicking and dragging the cursor
